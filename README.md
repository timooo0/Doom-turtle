# Doom-turtle
Use self-replicating computerCraft turtles to eat the world

ComputerCraft is a mod that introduces programmable computers and robots (turtles) into the world of Minecraft. We use these computer and turtle to complete mine the world, 
and use the found resources to make more turtle to mine more, to make more, to mine more, etc, etc. 

We start from a single Turtle with a stack of coal and a tree in front of it. Eventually there will be a sprawling 'community' of turtles working together to bring some delightfull
doom to the Minecraft world.




Sincerely yours,
Timo & Luuk
